# EDA-Project-loan

This repository contains the code and documentation for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on loan data. 
The goal of this project is to understand the data, clean it, and perform various analyses to extract insights.

## Introduction
In this project, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing loan information. 
The main steps include loading the data, cleaning it by handling null values and outliers, and performing various analyses to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into the following key steps:

1. **Load the Data**
2. **Study the Data**
3. **Observe and Handle Null Values**
4. **Handle Outliers**
5. **Univariate Analysis**
6. **Bivariate Analysis**
7. **Multivariate Analysis**

## Steps Overview

- **Load the Data**: Loading the dataset from a CSV file.
- **Study the Data**: Understanding the structure and summary of the data.
- **Observe and Handle Null Values**: Identifying and handling missing values.
- **Handle Outliers**: Detecting and handling outliers in the data.
- **Univariate Analysis**: Analyzing individual features.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Analyzing the relationship between pairs of features.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: Analyzing interactions between multiple features.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

1. **pandas**
2. **numpy**
3. **matplotlib**
4. **seaborn**
